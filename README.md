# PDF-to-TXT Converter
A command-line Java tool for batch-converting PDF files to TXT format using [Apache PDFBox](https://pdfbox.apache.org/). It supports filtering input files by filename wildcards (e.g., `*.pdf`, `report_??.pdf`) and last modified date ranges. Output `.txt` files are saved to a specified directory, which is created automatically if it doesn't exist.

## ⚙️ System Requirements
- **Java 11 or later** is required. You can download it from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11).
- Ensure that the `java` command is available in your system's `PATH`.  
You may also need to set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable on some systems. Instructions [here](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19182-01/821-0917/inst_jdk_javahome_t/index.html).

## 📘 How to Use
You can download the latest release from the **Releases** section of this repository, which includes the executable `pdf2txt.jar` and a `run_pdf2txt.bat` script for Windows users. This batch script prompts you for input and runs the `pdf2txt.jar` with the parameters you provide. Note that using the batch script is optional. You can still run the JAR file directly from the command line.

Alternatively, you can clone the repository and build the JAR manually using a Java IDE like [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=windows), or the `jar` command. Instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) and [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/guide/java/tutorials/hello-world/packaging-the-application).

To run the converter directly from the command line, you must use the following format:
```
java -jar pdf2txt.jar [source] [dest] [minDate] [maxDate]
```

### Arguments
- **`[source]`** – Path to the PDF files. Supports wildcards (e.g., `./input/report_?.pdf`).
- **`[dest]`** – Directory to save converted TXT files. (e.g., `./output/`).
- **`[minDate]`** – Min modified date for PDFs. (format: dd-MM-yyyy, e.g., `01-01-2022`).
- **`[maxDate]`** – Max modified date for PDFs. (format: dd-MM-yyyy, e.g., `01-01-2023`).  

All arguments are optional but must be provided in the order listed above. If one or more are omitted at the end, default values will be used for the missing ones:
- **`[source]`** → Current directory.
- **`[dest]`** → Current directory.
- **`[minDate]`** → 01-01-1970.
- **`[maxDate]`** → Current date.

### Limitations
- Arguments must be provided in order: `[source]`, `[dest]`, `[minDate]`, `[maxDate]`.
- Supports only wildcard patterns (`*` and `?`), not full regular expressions.
- Wildcards apply to filenames only, not directory names.
- The `*` wildcard is greedy (matches as many characters as possible).
- Date filtering is based on the file's last modified timestamp.
- Recursive folder traversal is not supported.

### Example 
```
java -jar pdf2txt.jar ./input/report_?.pdf ./output 01-01-2022 01-01-2023
```

This command will convert PDF files in the `./input` directory, modified between Jan 1, 2022, and Jan 1, 2023, into TXT files, saving them in the `.output` directory. If no matching files are found, an appropriate message will be displayed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Shell (e.g., Command Prompt, PowerShell, bash) may automatically expand wildcard characters before passing them to the converter, leading to unexpected behavior. To prevent this, you can either:
> - Run the JAR from a **Java IDE**, such as IntelliJ IDEA, which bypasses shell expansion.
> - Run the JAR from the command line, quoting the source path, though this may not fully prevent expansion.
